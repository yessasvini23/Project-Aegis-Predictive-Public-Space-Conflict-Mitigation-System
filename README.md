## 🚀 Overview

**Project Aegis** is an **AI-powered civic intelligence platform** that predicts and mitigates low-level, high-frequency public-space conflicts — before they escalate.

From *hawker–shopkeeper disputes* to *crowd congestion* and *water distribution frictions*, Aegis empowers city authorities with **data-driven foresight**, ensuring a more peaceful and organized public life.

> 🧭 “We don’t just detect problems. We predict and prevent them.”

## 🧠 Core Idea

Traditional governance reacts *after* conflicts occur.  
**Aegis** introduces a paradigm shift: **predict conflicts before they happen** by fusing diverse data streams:

| Data Source | Purpose | Example Insight |
|--------------|----------|----------------|
| 🗂️ Historical Grievances | Identify recurring civic issues | Complaint spikes every Thursday in Ward 5 |
| 📰 Social Sentiment | Detect rising tensions | Negative sentiment around “illegal hawkers” |
| 🏗️ Infrastructure Data | Find planned disruptions | Water maintenance or road closures |
| 🧍‍♂️ Mobility Trends | Track crowd density (anonymized) | Festival crowd increasing 5x in Sadar Bazaar |

All this data feeds into the **Friction Index Engine**, which produces a **risk heatmap** and **action recommendations**.

- 🧩 **AI Correlation Engine** finds hidden friction patterns.  
- 🗺️ **Heatmap Dashboard** visualizes zones by risk level.  
- ⚠️ **Proactive Alerts** recommend targeted interventions (deploy officers, notify citizens, adjust schedules).  
- 🧾 **Explainability Panel** shows *why* an area was flagged (transparent reasoning).

## 💡 Key Features

- 🗺️ **City Friction Heatmap** – Real-time, color-coded conflict likelihood zones.  
- 🤖 **Predictive AI Model** – Analyzes urban data fusion for risk scoring.  
- 🔍 **Explainable Insights** – Displays top contributing features.  
- 📢 **Smart Alerts** – Suggests preemptive civic or police actions.  
- 💬 **Citizen Communication** – Enables awareness messages to communities.  
- 🧭 **Ethical-by-Design** – Aggregated, anonymized, transparent, and fair.

## 🧬 Example API Response

```json
{
  "zone_id": "SadarBazaar-01",
  "risk_score": 0.82,
  "risk_category": "High",
  "recommended_actions": [
    "Deploy 2 beat officers between 3-7 PM",
    "Alert shopkeepers about designated hawker lanes"
  ],

}


📈 Social Impact
Metric	Outcome
⚡ Response Time	60% faster civic intervention
🧍 Citizen Satisfaction	Improved trust in local authorities
🚓 Police Efficiency	Smarter beat management & prevention
🌿 Community Harmony	Reduced street-level friction & complaints


🧭 Ethical AI & Data Privacy Principles
✅ Data Minimization – Collect only what’s essential, anonymized & aggregated
✅ Transparency & Explainability – Every alert includes human-readable reasons
✅ Human Oversight – AI assists; officials decide
✅ Fairness Audits – Routine checks to prevent geographic or socioeconomic bias
✅ Security by Design – Encryption, access control, and strict governance
✅ Open Accountability – Public feedback & audit logs maintained

🕊️ Predictive doesn’t mean intrusive — it means prepared.
